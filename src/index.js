console.log('%c HI', 'color: firebrick')


//Challenge 1
//Add JavaScript that:
//const imgUrl = "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random/4"
// on page load, fetches the images using the url above ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
// parses the response as JSON
// adds image elements to the DOM for each ü§î image in the array

//First I have to:
//[x] write a function that takes in a url and returns a fetch, and chains a .then to take the json response
//[x] pass the image url into the fetch function, chaining a .then callback function to iterate on the image array (so chaining a .message to make sure targeting the array, and not the response object), using a function to render images to the DOM as a callback
//[x] define a variable for the image container in global scope
//[x] write a render images function that creates image elements, sets their src values equal to the key.values from the json data, and appends them to the DOM
//[x] pass the render images function into the fetch function

//Challenge 2
//After the first challenge is completed, add JavaScript that:
//const breedUrl = "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all";
//on page load, fetches all the dog breeds using the url above ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
//adds the breeds to the page in the <ul> provided in index.html

//Then I will need to:
//[x] define a variable for the ul container in global scope
//[x] write a function to render the breeds to the DOM that creates a li element, sets the value equal to the keys in the json data, and appends them to the DOM
//[x] pass the render breeds function into the fetch function, returning the object keys and iterating over that array


//Challenge 3
//Once all of the breeds are rendered in the <ul>, add JavaScript so that, when the user clicks on any one of the <li>s, the font color of that <li> changes. This can be a color of your choosing.

//Then I will need to:
//[x] add an event listener to the li element in the render breeds function that passes in a click event, and a callback function that sets the color of the text to be red

//Challenge 4
//Once we are able to load all of the dog breeds onto the page, add JavaScript so that the user can filter breeds that start with a particular letter using a dropdown.
//For example, if the user selects 'a' in the dropdown, only show the breeds with names that start with the letter a. For simplicity, the dropdown only includes the letters a-d. However, we can imagine expanding this to include the entire alphabet.

//Lastly, I need to:
//[] name the select drop down to a variable in global scope
//[] add an event listener to the select drop down that passes in a change event and a callback function that renders breeds based on the first letter of their breed name
